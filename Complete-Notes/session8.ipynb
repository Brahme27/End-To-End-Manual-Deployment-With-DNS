    "# DNS (Domain Name System)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is DNS?\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS converts human-readable names into IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans remember names.\n",
    "Computers understand numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "facebook.com → IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "Like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Word → Meaning\n",
    "Name → Number\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why DNS is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Servers use IP addresses.\n",
    "But IP addresses can change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IP Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "* Public IP changes when you stop and start instance\n",
    "* Private IP changes when you terminate and recreate instance\n",
    "\n",
    "If backend IP changes and you hardcode IP in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* systemctl service file\n",
    "* Nginx config\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you must edit file, reload daemon, and restart service.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS solves this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using IP:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "172.31.x.x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mysql.daws81s.online\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now even if IP changes, only DNS record needs update. No config change required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# How DNS Works (Step by Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "User enters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mysql.daws82s.online\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Step 1: DNS Resolver\n",
    "\n",
    "Your system asks DNS resolver (usually ISP or local DNS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Root Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolver asks root DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 13 root server systems globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are managed under ICANN.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Global domain system\n",
    "* Root servers\n",
    "* Top-level domains\n",
    "\n",
    "It delegates TLD management to organizations.\n",

    "\n",
    "If someone wants to create new TLD like:\n",
