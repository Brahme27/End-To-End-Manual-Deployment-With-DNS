    "## 1. Types of Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Desktop Applications\n",
    "Applications that are installed directly on a user’s computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Desktop Applications\n",
    "1. Need to install on every system  \n",
    "2. Upgrades must be done manually  \n",
    "3. Uses local storage  \n",
    "4. Compatibility issues  \n",
    "5. If system crashes, data may be lost  \n",
    "6. Uses more system resources  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Applications\n",
    "Applications accessed using a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- No installation required  \n",
    "- Centralized updates  \n",
    "- Data stored on servers  \n",
    "- Accessible from anywhere  \n",

    "# Understanding 3-Tier Architecture with Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadside Cart (Single Person System)\n",
    "\n",
    "1 person handling 10 customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "That one person:\n",
    "- Cooks  \n",
    "- Collects bills  \n",
    "- Serves food  \n",
    "- Manages queue  \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "- Overloaded  \n",
    "- Slow service  \n",
    "- No proper separation of work  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Small Hotel (Shared Responsibilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "2 persons handling 50 customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 cook → Cooking and serving  \n",
    "- 1 owner → Token issue and bill collection  \n",
    "\n",
    "Better than cart, but still limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restaurant (Structured System)\n",
    "\n",
    "500 customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work is divided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Captain → Welcomes customers and shows table  \n",
    "- Waiter → Takes order and serves  \n",
    "- Chef → Cooks food  \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. Responsibilities are shared  \n",
    "2. Each person focuses only on their task  \n",
    "3. Better security  \n",
    "4. Proper queue handling  \n",
    "5. Can handle more customers  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping This to IT\n",

    "Raw items → Cooking → Plating  \n",
    "Raw data → Processing → Presentation  \n",
