    "\n",
    "Example: VPN\n",

    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- Client knows it is using proxy  \n",
    "- Server does not know client is using proxy  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses\n",
    "- Traffic restriction  \n",
    "- Traffic monitoring  \n",
    "- Hide geolocation  \n",
    "- Anonymous identity  \n",
    "- Access private network  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reverse Proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- Client does not know about proxy  \n",
    "- Server knows it is behind proxy  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Used\n",
    "- Backend applications are hidden  \n",
    "- Security  \n",
    "- Load balancing  \n",
    "- Request queuing  \n",
    "- Caching  \n",
